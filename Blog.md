## Legal Contract Formation in Smart Contract Code (draft)
June 6, 2021 (*in progress*)

In most civil and common law legal systems, a "contract" may be summarized as any legally enforceable agreement between two or more parties. Smart/Ricardian contracts and traditional, written contracts may be used in tandem to provide deterministic execution alongside legal enforceability in such hybrid agreements, while leaving flexibility for sensitive "meatspace" terms and mutual amendments in the parties' preferences. The fundamental underpinnings of contract law present some novel hypos about when, or whether, the formation of a legally recognizable contract, or element thereof, is evidenced by the express or implied intent of a smart contract's code, or more granularly, by changes in state or other operations on the permissionless execution layer, such as the Ethereum blockchain. Commercial law has long recognized some instances of ability to form a legal contract even in the absence of a written agreement, for example, for a contract for sale of goods as set forth in UCC § 2-207(3): "conduct by both parties which recognizes the existence of a contract is sufficient to establish a contract for sale although the writings of the parties do not otherwise establish a contract"; this article examines some elements of legal contract formation within a blockchain context, primarily from the perspective of US law and the UCC.

The basic formula for a contract's formation: Offer + Acceptance + Consideration = Contract.

### Offer
• if a participant is able to exchange value with or interact with via a smart contract through its construction (i.e. *public* or *external* functions without restrictive modifiers, or with such a restriction for which an offeror is whitelisted, etc.) and consideration may be given through the offered interface, this could be deemed an open offer; if the smart contract whitelists a counterparty's address for interaction or requests signature from a counterparty's address, that smart contract may constitute an offer solely to that counterparty;

### Acceptance
• by private key signature or indicating acceptance by sending value to a smart contract (subject to some commercial law limitations/qualifications on acceptance), the counterparty may indicate acceptance to the agreement as an analog to commonly accepted centralized electronic signatures. For example, UCC § 2-206(1)(a): "an offer to make a contract shall be construed as inviting acceptance in any manner and by any medium reasonable in the circumstances"; and

### Consideration
• the element of consideration may be satisfied provided each party interacting in some manner via smart contract exchanges some form of value (which could be ETH, tokens, or arguably merely the gas cost, as examined below).

Meatspace legal enforcement of rights, obligations, intent, and other aspects of the underpinning agreements may be still available except to the extent expressly waived (subject to applicable law). Contract law and UCC specialists will find much to deliberate on concepts such as whether an analogous digital “firm offer” (a signed offer that gives assurance it will remain is irrevocable for a lack of consideration during the time stated or a reasonable time of no longer than three months) can conceivably exist in a time-limited and consideration-soliciting public smart contract function, or how immutability affects provisions on amendments, offer revocations, etc. 

**** Note: whether open source licenses form contracts is an oft-deliberated question (see Chapter 15, The Open Source Alternative: Understanding Risks and Leveraging Opportunities by Heather Meeker. Open source licenses clearly involve an offer: The licensor makes the software and states the terms on which it may be used (i.e., the open source license). They also clearly involve consideration, because every open source license has some requirements for exercising the license, ranging from the notice requirements of permissive licenses to the copyleft requirements of hereditary licenses. The difficult element is acceptance.

### Control
'Control' of assets, information, and authoritative copes have broad legal implications. For example, Section 9-105 of the Model UCC deals with the control of electronic chattel paper for purposes of security interest perfection, and Official Comment 3 to Section 9-105 provides that 'control' must be evidenced by a system which evidences the transfer of interests in electronic chattel paper in a manner which 'reliably' (according to general unspecified principles of uniqueness, identifiability and un-alterability) establishes that the secured party is the assignee of the electronic chattel paper, but need not be more stringent than those requirements for physical chattel paper. One might envision a future official comment that extends such uniqueness, identifiability and un-alterability requirements to digital assets/hash pointers stored at an Ethereum address and the control thereof as being no more strigent than those requirements for electronic chattel paper. Given that UCC § 9-105(b) hasn't had significant judicial interpretations or regulatory guidance as of the date of this writing, treatment in a blockchain context is hypothetical, but intuitively extrapolated to control of a wallet address, or onlyOwner status for a contract. 

Another pending item of contract/commercial legal framework to watch is the newly proposed article 12 of the UCC, addressing commercial transactions of "controllable electronic records" or 'CERs'. Such controllable electronic records's definition is likely to include digital assets of various forms, including cryptocurrencies, hard-asset secured digital assets and many flavors of NFTs. The ongoing proposal by the Uniform Law Commission is highly encouraging, and should provide much-needed clarity and standardization of secured transactions involving CERs, thus providing a pathway for compliant and more sophisticated contracts and agreements. The concept and interpretation of 'control' is an imperative focus to establish rules around perfection and priority of claims on CERs, and actual and constructive possession of CERs.

### Claimable() 
For income tax purposes, farmed assets, airdrops, and hard forks have potential implications as being constructively-received income, and may introduce underdiscussed moment-of-privity deliberations for such distributed assets that grant certain rights to their holder. Under many tax regimes including the US, one is generally taxed on income that is available to them, regardless of whether it is actually in possession. Whether or not a moment of privity has been established may be irrelevant for taxation purposes, and the intricacies get even stickier if the constructively available token has market value but there is a question of whether the constructive possessor has actual knowledge or reasonably should have knowledge of the token's existence: for example, is constructive receipt established if the token isn't visible until the contract address is added manually to a wallet interface, or the ability to claim requires navigation to a particular UI or calling a specific function? Similarly, one might question the extent to which the concept of assignment of income (income received by an agent for someone) is constructively received by instances such as smart contracts that receive (anticipated or unanticipated) tokens earmarked for periodic distribution or 'streaming payment' to a destination address you control.

### Gas as Consideration. 
"Consideration" in legal contract formation operates to evidence two main elements: (1) a mutual bargain between parties, and (2) a legal detriment (something one is not legally obligated to do or something one must refrain from doing that one is legally privileged to do) induced by the promise of such bargain and vice versa. The purposes of consideration include:
  1.	An evidentiary function: providing objective evidence that the parties intended to make a binding agreement
  2.	A cautionary function: the detriment of consideration is meant to encourage parties to be cautious in their entry into agreements, and less likely to make thoughtless or bad bargains or mistakes
  3.	Context for facts and circumstances in the underlying contract's interpretation, proof, deliberation, capacity of parties
  4.	Evidence, cautioning, challenging as to certain contract formalities
Anyone transacting on Ethereum mainnet can readily identify with the quantifiable and apparent detriment posed by gas costs; however, the cost is not necessarily proportional to the value transferred or accessed as much as the complexity of the operation (or quality of the code), nor does the ether paid as gas costs directly induce the promisor counterparty (instead going to miners or, per EIP 1559, to the incinerator). Especially as scaling solutions kick in, gas costs might be deemed "nominal" consideration outside of especially sophisticated/high-gas or operations or anticipated recurring gas costs (for example, entering a complex DeFi dApp requiring periodic harvests or unstaking/withdrawing liquidity).

### Escrowed Liquidated Damages. 
The concept of liquidated damages to remedy one party's injury from the other's breach usually requires such damages to reasonably estimate the harm to be rectified and not operate as a punishment to the breaching party. In the context of smart contract escrow, a msg.value contributed to a contract which programmatically sets out the amount retained and transferred to an injured party in the event of msg.sender's breach or nonperformance essentially creates pure and automatic liquidated damages. This mechanism permits collection of liquidated damages with programmatically evidenced consent by msg.sender's assent by escrowing value, and allows enforcement even against anonymous and therefore otherwise impractically enforceable counterparties. 


### UCC Article 8 Securities Intermediary
  The original drafting of Article 8 contemplated possession of physical certificates to evidence ownership of securities, and changes in ownership accomplished by delivery of such certificates. The 1978 amendment permitted issuers to eschew physical certificates in favor of merely reflecting changes in ownershup in the records of the issuer by duly instructed direction. This has resulted in the correct status quo of clearing corporations (most notably the Depository Trust Company's indirect holding system) holding the vast majority of public securities' certificates and settlement of securities trading occurring by digital entries in the centralized records of the clearing corporations and designated securities intermediaries. In practice, the transactions between broker-dealers are netted daily to avoid overwhelming amounts of paperwork - analogous to state channel usage for scaling blockchain transaction throughput.  



## Small Business Savings with Smart Contracts
January 3, 2020

Enterprises of all sizes stand to benefit from the immense savings and security of deterministic Ricardian agreements, smart contract automation of various tasks and areas of trust, increased liquidity through tokenization, and easy monetization of their data. However, small businesses may capture the greatest relative benefit, as they codify away previously expensive areas of third party trust and contract enforcement. Small businesses are cash and time-strapped, and often must prioritize between improving ongoing operations, pitching new business, and chasing delinquent bills or deliveries. They’re unlikely to take the time and money to rectify the many frictions of current agreements (such as laborious debt collection or a prohibitively costly small claims court action), and would benefit highly from deterministic agreements and predictable, ensured payments that remove these frictions. 

Small businesses generally suffer from high comparative costs of trust and enforcement of agreements, through the limited manpower and funds demanded in chasing accounts receivable, mitigating or litigating contract breaches, and reallocating resources to accommodate unexpected lapses in payment. Similarly, administrative and regulatory concerns are expensive to small businesses that must scrap together compliance, legal, accounting, and tax departments from few participants in the business (to sometimes only one sole proprietor) already spread thin in the commercial operation of their enterprise. 

Through Ricardian contracts, small businesses may automate some of these chainsaws that entrepreneurs must currently juggle. Payments through blockchain smart contracts are virtually instantaneous and not subject to chargebacks. Even if customers with web3 wallets are few and far between, solutions abound in point of payment fiat on and offramps, and legacy payment system triggers via oracles. Payroll taxes and withholdings may be automated (and updated) via a Ricardian employment agreement (as demonstrated by OpenLaw). Many corporate organization and governance tasks, registry/administrative reporting, etc. may be maintained and automated by creating a type of hybrid LLC (limited liability company) and DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) structure known as a LAO (limited liability autonomous organization). LAOs are intended to limit business owners’ liability by apportioning company and members’ liability through traditional drafting and corporate structure, with the benefits of decentralized Ricardian contracts’ deterministic execution of company processes, revenue streams, tax and filing fees, etc.

Once small businesses incorporate basic smart contract/web3 infrastructure, doors to other opportunities in decentralized finance and governance open. For example, in some applicable industries (i.e. high value, low count inventory or prototyped products), small businesses may look to vastly increase their liquidity by tokenizing inventory, assets, or even intellectual property. For entities that are sensitive to commodity or other raw material price fluctuations, the emergence of synthetic derivatives present simple futures/swaps as a low barrier-to-entry hedge for such supply prices, provided the UX for such instruments is necessarily simple and well-audited. The size and nature of small businesses make it possible that some outfits would be exempt from some onerous regulatory requirements for the above (for example, security reporting for tokenizations theorized above may be unnecessary for those entities below a threshold amount of value). The CFTC/SEC would do well to provide guidance in this arena as adoption increases, and the Small Business Administration and the Chamber of Digital Commerce could unlock immense opportunity together in exploring the benefits of decentralized infrastructure for cash-and-time-strapped entrepreneurs and small businesses.

## Smart Escrow Contracts
March 14, 2019

The traditional Escrow Agreement: an arrangement in which the solution to value transfer between two or more adverse, transacting parties is rectified by placing payment, signatures, and/or other conditions or actions in the control of an ostensibly neutral third party, to be disbursed upon the satisfaction of all required “conditions precedent” to a transaction’s closing. Few agreements present such an imbalance of complexity versus cost and are as ripe for disruption as the simple escrow agreement. Traditional escrow agreements tend to suffer from such disadvantages, inefficiencies, and issues as:

- Restriction to the banking/institutional hours of the escrow agent, which may cause issues in closing timing and additional costs and legal fees to expedite satisfaction of other conditions precedent in order to meet such deadlines. There are often additional costs to transfer funds and use different branches of the escrow agent (if even available) if banking hours expire and the parties must close outside of local banking hours. Such additional costs may include:

  1) Interest rate slippage, swap/break costs, costs to parties to re-price transaction if delayed to the next business day;

  2) Accommodating geographic concerns for any temporary time zone overlap of the parties, or the location of any underlying asset(s) if moving between jurisdictions of different legal or tax favorability, etc.;

  3) Tax timing considerations (for example if transaction must close at the expiry of a party’s fiscal year or the calendar year).

- Exorbitant escrow fees for an inherently non-complex task (commonly $5,000 to $25,000);

- High legal fees for negotiating the mechanics and payment waterfall/distribution logistics surrounding the timing inflexibility of banking hours and other eccentricities of escrow agent institutions;

- Prolonging the negotiation and deal process (and accompanying costs and legal fees), and the escrow agent often is permitted to resign with reasonable notice, necessitating a substitute escrow agent;

- Using a bank often requires a separate set of extensive documentation to comply with the relevant anti-money laundering regulations, such as the Bank Secrecy Act (for the USA), beyond those required in the underlying transaction; and

- Inherently relying on the parties’ trust of a third party, centralized entity, which presents an additional layer of security risk and potentially misaligned incentives including giving the escrow institution access to otherwise confidential information;

  1) Escrow agreements commonly include broad indemnities absolving the escrow agent of human error, such as excluding liability “for any error in judgment made in good faith by an officer or employee of the escrow agent unless it shall be proved that the escrow agent was grossly negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts or acted intentionally in bad faith.” Thus, simple negligence or system errors often do not provide redress for the parties; and

  2) Escrow agreements commonly include auto-compliance clauses that may leave the escrow agent’s processing of funds at the whims of pending litigation or arbitration.

Smart contracts are poised to disrupt the traditional escrow agreement. By placing funds via fiat currencies converted to cryptocurrency, stablecoins or tokens; e-signatures; rights to ownership or title via tokens; or other digital consents into a smart escrow contract, transacting parties may effectively eliminate the numerous problems enumerated above by using a trustless blockchain protocol to act as “escrow agent.” 

The escrowed funds may be released at any time of day or night, upon the condition of the parties’ choosing, which may be stipulated in the transaction’s core documents (for example, in the conditions precedent section of a loan agreement), or as a separate side letter between the parties, that agrees on the terms of the smart escrow contract. Release of the smart escrow may occur upon (i) sending payment (at any time) to the smart escrow address, (ii) satisfaction of a condition via an external condition as reported to the smart escrow contract by oracles (e.g., the coordinates of an underlying asset match a desired closing jurisdiction, or a certain level of interest rate fluctuation), or (iii) fulfilled e-signatures (such as the recently announced DocuSign Listener, which may trigger Clause.io’s “Smart Clauses” upon e-signature execution). Thus, when the transaction proceeds towards closing, an escrow agent institution would no longer be a limitation on consummating the deal.

As always, it is imperative to audit the smart escrow contract for any potential security issues, and to ensure the smart contract reflects the intention of the parties. The parties should also consider a time limitation or other condition to automatically return escrowed funds in the event the transaction is not ultimately consummated or upon mutual agreement, to prevent lockup of funds for an undetermined period should conflict between the transacting parties or other unexpected conditions arise.
